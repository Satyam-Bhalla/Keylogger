# Key logger in Python3
 This keylogger is capable of getting all the typed words from the victim's keyboard.
 It will automatically create a batch file and add that file to the windows startup services.
 It can also take screenshots of user work and with the help of our SMTP module we can send
 the text and images to anyone via Email.

# How to use
Open cmd and type `pip install requirements.txt` 

# For local storage just use
> python Audio.py


# For Sending an email to your ID
> python Audio.py email

### Note:
You need to set the email id and password in `Keylogger.py` file for the email support.
Install all the dependencies from `requirements.txt`
